# GUI excercise

GUI app:
- takes in entries from input fields
- checks validity
- if input errors, display error message
- if no input errors, save the data (json?) 
- display data on the bottom text field.


first step, rudimentary gui

add event listener for THE BUTTON, send form action, should call a function to process whatever is in the input fields at the time, then save it accordingly.
potentially output a message in the text field just above THE BUTTON 

List saved data in the proper structured way below THE BUTTON.

ex: 

<APPLICANT NAME0> created at  : <H><M>
<APPLICANT NAME1> created at  : <H><M>
<APPLICANT NAME2> created at  : <H><M>
<APPLICANT NAME3> created at  : <H><M>

Finally.. cosmetics
